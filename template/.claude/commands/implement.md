Read the task file provided for this session.

Orient first:
1. Read the task file and identify the next incomplete task
2. Read the test file(s) for that task
3. Read the source files the task will modify
4. Confirm you understand the expected behavior before writing

Implement ONLY the next incomplete task. Not multiple.

Rules:
- Make the failing tests pass
- Follow existing code patterns
- Do not modify any existing tests
- Do not add functionality beyond what the task specifies
- Commit when the task's tests pass

Run the full test suite after implementation.
If unrelated tests break, fix the regression without changing those tests.
Update the task file to mark this task complete.
