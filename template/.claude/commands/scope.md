You are scoping a new feature. Do not write code or create files yet.

Read the feature description provided for this session.

Explore the codebase to understand:
1. What areas are relevant to the described feature
2. What existing patterns and conventions apply
3. What dependencies and constraints exist

Produce:
- One-paragraph description (what and why)
- 3–7 testable acceptance criteria (each verifiable by an automated test)
- List of files and areas that will likely change

If acceptance criteria exceed 7, recommend how to split into smaller features.

Output formatted for `/specs/_TEMPLATE.md`.
