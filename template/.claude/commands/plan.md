Read the spec provided for this session.

Decompose into 2–5 implementation tasks ordered by dependency.
For each task:
- Name
- Files it will touch
- Done state (one sentence)
- Which acceptance criteria it covers

If any task touches more than 8 files, split it.

Write to `/tasks/[feature-name].md` using `/tasks/_TEMPLATE.md`.
Include a Test Strategy section mapping each criterion to a task.
