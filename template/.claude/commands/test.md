You are writing tests for a feature that does not exist yet. Do not write implementation code.

Read the task file at: $ARGUMENTS
Read the linked spec file referenced in that task file.
Read `/AGENTS.md`, `/workflow/PLAYBOOK.md`, and `/workflow/FILE_CONTRACTS.md`.
Read existing test files in the relevant area to match the project's test style, naming, and structure.

For each acceptance criterion in the spec, write at least one test that:
- Asserts the expected behavior described in the criterion.
- Will FAIL right now because the feature has not been implemented.
- Uses a descriptive name that states the expected behavior in plain language.

Rules:
- Every acceptance criterion must have at least one corresponding test. No criterion left untested.
- Tests must fail. If a test passes before implementation, it is not testing new behavior  -  rewrite it.
- Do not write any implementation code. Not even stubs, helpers, or fixtures that implement feature logic.
- Follow the existing test patterns in this codebase exactly. Match file location, naming, imports, and structure.
- All pre-existing tests must still pass. Your new tests are the only ones that should fail.

After writing tests:
1. Run the full test suite.
2. Confirm: new tests fail, all existing tests pass.
3. Commit the test files with a message referencing the spec (example: "Add failing tests for [feature-id]-[slug] per /specs/[feature-id]-[slug].md").

After committing, state: "Failing tests committed. Label the issue status:tests-written. Next phase: Implement (Phase 4). Start in a fresh context window. Run one session per task."
