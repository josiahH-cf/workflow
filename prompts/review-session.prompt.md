You are reviewing completed feature branches and preparing them for merge. You will process one feature at a time through review, and if it passes, create its pull request.

For each feature, work through the following:

PHASE 5 — REVIEW
Read the spec at /specs/[feature-name].md, the task file at /tasks/[feature-name].md, and the full diff of the feature branch against the target branch.

Evaluate every item below. For each, report PASS or FAIL with specific evidence.

Acceptance criteria coverage — for each criterion in the spec:
- Does a test exist that verifies this criterion?
- Does the implementation satisfy the criterion?
- Report: PASS with test location, or FAIL with what is missing.

Code quality:
- No existing tests were modified to accommodate the new code.
- No files outside the spec's Affected Areas were changed.
- No hardcoded values, secrets, or environment-specific strings.
- No functions over 50 lines.
- No dead code or unused imports.
- Error handling is explicit, not silent.
- Naming is consistent with existing codebase conventions.

Produce a summary:
- Total criteria: [N], Passed: [N], Failed: [N]
- Code quality issues: [list or "None"]

If ALL checks pass:
- State: "Review PASSED for [feature-name]."
- Proceed to Phase 6 below.

If ANY check fails:
- List each failure with the specific fix needed.
- State: "Review FAILED for [feature-name]. These issues must be addressed in a Build session before this feature can proceed."
- Do not create a PR. Move to the next feature if there are more to review.

PHASE 5b — CROSS-REVIEW (when applicable)
If you are a different agent or model than the one that built AND initially reviewed this feature, your Phase 5 evaluation above serves as the cross-review. State this explicitly in the report.

If you are the same agent that built the feature, note: "Self-reviewed only. Cross-review by a different agent is recommended before merge."

PHASE 6 — PR CREATE (only for features that passed review)
Read the PR template at /.github/pull_request_template.md if it exists.
Read the full diff of the feature branch against the target branch.

Produce the pull request:
- Title: concise imperative summary
- What: one sentence
- Why: link to /specs/[feature-name].md
- Changes: logical changes grouped by area
- Testing checklist: check each box honestly — if any cannot be checked, leave it unchecked and explain
- Non-code checklist: same — honest checks only
- Verification: how a reviewer can verify beyond reading the diff
- Rollback: special steps or "Standard revert."
- If the diff exceeds 300 lines, state this and recommend splitting before opening.

Open the PR against the target branch.
State: "PR created for [feature-name]. Ready for human review (Phase 7)."

After completing review (and PR if applicable) for one feature:
- Ask: "Would you like to review another feature, or is this review session complete?"

If another feature: ask for the next feature name and repeat from Phase 5.
If complete: produce a session summary:
  - Features reviewed
  - Status of each: PR created / failed review (with reason)
  - Any features needing a Build session to address failures

State: "All features that passed review have open PRs. Remaining items need Build sessions to address review failures. Human review (Phase 7) can proceed on the open PRs — estimated 10 minutes per PR using the non-code checklist."
PLAN (interactive, batch)
  Phase 0: Ideate → Issue            ↺ repeat per idea
  Phase 1: Scope  → Spec               ↰ split back to Phase 0 if criteria > 7
  Phase 2: Plan   → Tasks / ExecPlan   ↰ split back to Phase 1 if tasks > 5
  → "Plan another?" loop

BUILD (autonomous, one feature per session)
  Phase 3: Test   → Committed failing tests
  Phase 4: Implement → Committed code   ↺ repeat per task
  → Resume in fresh session if context constrained

REVIEW & SHIP (batch)
  Phase 5/5b: Review → PASS/FAIL report   ↰ fail sends back to Build
  Phase 6: PR Create (on pass)
  → "Review another?" loop

HUMAN (Phase 7)
  Merge via non-code checklist → Done
