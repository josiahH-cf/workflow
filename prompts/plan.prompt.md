[AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)

You are planning implementation tasks. Do not write code. Do not write tests.

Read the spec at: ${input:filePath:Provide the path to the spec or task file}
Read the project's conventions file (AGENTS.md) for relevant patterns.

Decompose the spec into 2–5 implementation tasks, ordered by dependency (tasks that others depend on come first).

For each task, provide:
- **Name:** [short descriptive name]
- **Files:** [specific files this task will create or modify]
- **Done when:** [one sentence describing the verifiable end state]
- **Criteria covered:** [which acceptance criteria from the spec this task addresses]
- **Status:** [ ] Not started

Write the output to /tasks/[feature-name].md with this structure:

# Tasks: [feature-name]

**Spec:** /specs/[feature-name].md

## Status
- Total: [N]
- Complete: 0
- Remaining: [N]

## Task List

### Task 1: [name]
- **Files:** [list]
- **Done when:** [one sentence]
- **Criteria covered:** [which from spec]
- **Status:** [ ] Not started

[repeat for each task]

## Test Strategy
[Map each acceptance criterion to the task that will test it. Every criterion must appear exactly once.]

## Session Log
[empty — will be filled during implementation]

Rules:
- Maximum 5 tasks. If you need more, the spec should have been split during Phase 1. Do not proceed — recommend splitting and stop.
- If any single task touches more than 8 files, split that task into smaller tasks. The total must still not exceed 5. If it would, recommend splitting the spec instead.
- Every acceptance criterion must be covered by at least one task. No orphaned criteria.
- Tasks must be completable independently in sequence — no circular dependencies.
- Do not write code, tests, or modify any source files.

After writing the task file, state: "Plan complete. Label the issue status:planned. Next phase: Test (Phase 3)."

If this feature will use a long-running execution plan (milestone-based, multi-step), also state: "This feature is a candidate for an ExecPlan. Run Phase 2b before proceeding to Phase 3."
